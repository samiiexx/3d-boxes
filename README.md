# 3D Boxes Background
Project #40 in Brad Traversy's 50 Projects in 50 Days. In this 3D effect project, a background gif is used as a background image and the background position is dynamically calculated so the image can be moved. When the button is clicked, the images are combined and the spacing is removed.
